[#FF0000]Dragging[#000000] is a cinch! Choose your [#FF0000]starting point[#000000] carefully for precise control. Past that, it's just like drawing. [#FF0000]Make combat your canvas![#000000]
This is as basic as it gets. Whether it's an [#FF0000]enemy[#000000], a [#FF0000]pin[#000000], or [#FF0000]empty space[#000000], just give it a quick [#FF0000]tap[#000000], and you're on your way!
The [#FF0000]slash[#000000] is a more advanced command! Learn to use [#FF0000]light, quick flicks[#000000] when drawing lines across your target.
[#FF0000]Pressing[#000000] isn't that difficult, but if you [#FF0000]move your finger while pressing[#000000], it can accidentally [#FF0000]turn into a drag[#000000]. Keep that digit steady, soldier!
Many effective psychs use obstacles as weapons. It can be easy to overlook the junk lying around, but that junk can save your hide!
PP earned at the Results Screen after battle [#FF0000]only go into pins Neku is wearing[#000000]. [#FF0000]Cycle out old pins for new ones[#000000] to grow your whole arsenal!
As you wear more and more pins at a time, [#FF0000]their controls can start to overlap[#000000]. If that happens, try setting [#FF0000]half of them to sub-slots[#000000].
It's impossible to completely use up pins, so go wild! Use them freely in combat and find the set that works best with [#FF0000]your own personal style[#000000].
[#FF0000]HP Drain[#000000] causes you to gradually lose HP. [#FF0000]Attack Break[#000000] and [#FF0000]Defense Break[#000000] lower those stats. [#FF0000]Immobility[#000000] stuns you.
Pins will only evolve [#FF0000]when they level up[#000000]. It seems the secret to getting your pins to evolve has to do with [#FF0000]the way they grow[#000000]...
If you run into foes [#FF0000]resistant to an affinity[#000000], you'll want to try switching the affinities of the pins Neku is wearing and [#FF0000]find a weakness[#000000].
Run from battle, and [#FF0000]your partner will grow angrier each time[#000000], causing your [#FF0000]sync rate to drop[#000000].
Look out for [#FF0000]Noise symbols[#000000] when reading people's thoughts. Accidentally tap a Noise symbol, and you'll wind up in battle!
Noise symbols come in different [#FF0000]shapes and sizes[#000000]. Looking to fight a certain type of Noise? Pay attention to the symbol!
During [#FF0000]chain Noise reduction[#000000], Noise [#FF0000]get tougher with each passing \x22reduction\x22 (round)[#000000], but you also earn [#FF0000]more PP[#000000] if you win.
Naturally occurring stray Noise are [#FF0000]gloomy[#000000], and tend to [#FF0000]gather in shadowy areas[#000000]. If you're looking for a fight, find a shady spot to scan.
If the [#FF0000]battle difficulty[#000000] is set to [#FF0000]Hard or above[#000000] when you face a boss Noise, a record of your battle time will be listed in the Noise Report.
Pig Noise hide throughout Shibuya. Find and beat them for guaranteed pin drops! However, [#FF0000]each breed calls for special tactics[#000000]...
Negative Noise [#FF0000]possess people and objects[#000000]. Dispelling them through battle often [#FF0000]moves the story along[#000000], so if you see them, take 'em out!
Taboo Noise can scan, too. If you open your mind, they will sense it and move in--[#FF0000]sometimes in numbers[#000000]! You [#FF0000]can't run[#000000] from Taboo battles.
Memes are quick to come and go. Memes you need are always found the [#FF0000]same story day[#000000], and once that day comes to a close, they [#FF0000]vanish[#000000].
Sometimes your partner will give you [#FF0000]hints[#000000]. If you want to solve puzzles yourself, you [#FF0000]don't have to talk to them[#000000]. Play it your way!
If you've forgotten what the [#FF0000]Reapers' mission[#000000] for the day is, or haven't picked up the game in a while, use this to get your bearings.
You only receive [#FF0000]Attack[#000000] bonuses in battle for shaping the trends. Support pins that lack offensive capability [#FF0000]won't receive any bonus[#000000].
Don't feel bad when work, school, and the rest of your life tear you away from Shibuya for a while. The [#FF0000]Shutdown PP system[#000000] has your back!
If a QUEST item asks for [#FF0000]pins[#000000], you will need to [#FF0000]master them first[#000000]. Power those pins up to their max level, then hit the shops!
[#FF0000]Different clerks will unlock different items[#000000] for you. And hey, nobody ever said an item's ability has to be unlocked at the store it came from!
QUEST items come in [#FF0000]two varieties[#000000]. If the QUEST label is in [#FF0000]yellow text[#000000], you can only make [#FF0000]one[#000000]. But if the text is [#FF0000]blue[#000000], make [#FF0000]as many as you like[#000000]!
You can use [#FF0000]any pin you own[#000000] in Tin Pin games. Each has its own [#FF0000]stats[#000000], so take a peek at the [#FF0000]TIN PIN info tab[#000000] before slammin'!

Spin on your pin can be a pain when it happens accidentally, but master the Spin Slam and you'll be a dodging, [#FF0000]counterslamming[#000000] machine!
The Dive Bomber [#FF0000]beats the Sledgehammer[#000000]. If your opponent busts out the hammer, jump!
The Stinger [#FF0000]beats the Dive Bomber[#000000]. Counter oncoming foes, or pair it up with the Charge Slam and bring the sting to them!
The Sledgehammer [#FF0000]beats the Stinger[#000000]. Pound right through your opponent's defenses for a knockout!
Sometimes a Helping Hand [#FF0000]isn't enough to get you back on the table[#000000]. And even if you do make it, an [#FF0000]opponent may be waiting[#000000]. Hang in there!
Here's a little secret to get you started: [#FF0000]two types of PP[#000000] go into your pins—[#FF0000]Battle PP[#000000] and [#FF0000]Shutdown PP[#000000]. Control their balance to control evolution!
Here's a little-known fact: the more whammies you land in a game of Tin Pin Slammer, the more [#FF0000]PP[#000000] you'll earn when you win!
Battle PP is the easiest type of PP to earn. [#FF0000]Chaining battles[#000000] and earning a [#FF0000]high combat rank[#000000] will score you a truckload of PP in a hurry!
The amount of Shutdown PP you earn [#FF0000]varies based on the way you play[#000000], making it a bit tricky. But don't let it cramp your style!
Changing up the order of your pins can be fun from time to time, and it also affects their [#FF0000]activation priority[#000000]. Find the right fit for you!
Want to breeze through Taboo Noise fights? Land those [#FF0000]cross combos[#000000]! It all comes down to your pins. Find a [#FF0000]good match[#000000] for your partner.
Some items grant abilities that [#FF0000]boost your sync rate[#000000] or [#FF0000]extend your Fusion time[#000000]. You'll want to get your hands on those ASAP!
Here's a little trick: Neku and his partner can go into battle with [#FF0000]over 100% sync rate[#000000] if [#FF0000]Neku wears the right threads[#000000].
If his aerial combo hits, Neku will be relatively safe from counterattacks. Mix and match psychs and design your own original combo!
The \x22Piercing Pillar\x22 and \x22Vulcan Uppercut\x22 psychs are both invoked with an upward slash. [#FF0000]Prioritize them[#000000] so their attacks link together!
[#FF0000]You can always eat 6 more bytes.[#000000] Use that hollow leg to keep snacking on [#FF0000]less filling items[#000000] that boost [#FF0000]Bravery, HP, or sync rate[#000000]!
Abilities that let you go into battle with a sync rate boost [#FF0000]only last for the duration of combat[#000000]. The boost is not permanent.
Some pins must be [#FF0000]equipped as a set[#000000] to use them to their full potential. Look for a hint in their descriptions!
Playing Reaper Creeper requires [#FF0000]Matoya's spell[#000000], but \x22UNEMS DEE DEHTNO IKI HSSSERP\x22 just sounds silly, so most folks don't bother!
Your partner won't take damage from the Noise, so focus on keeping Neku out of harm's way!
