As is common knowledge, all [#FF0000]Games[#000000] in the [#FF0000]UG[#000000] take place under [#FF0000]Our supervision[#000000]. However, this particular Game is saddled with a nigh-unbelievable set of [#FF0000]extenuating circumstances[#000000], catching the attention of the [#FF0000]Higher Plane[#000000]. Thus, I shall be taking a more hands-on role this time, as detailed in this [#FF0000]report[#000000].\n\nThe core [#FF0000]differences[#000000] in this Game are as follows:
1: its role in [#FF0000]plans for Shibuya's destruction[#000000],\n2: the [#FF0000]Composer's absence[#000000] from the UG,\n3: the resulting [#FF0000]limitations to his powers[#000000], and\n4: the Game being played by a [#FF0000]proxy[#000000].\n\nThe [#FF0000]Composer[#000000] has informed me of two major points: that [#FF0000]he plans to destroy the UG[#000000], but also that his [#FF0000]final decision[#000000] will hinge on the [#FF0000]outcome of his Game with the Conductor[#000000].\n\nA provisional [#FF0000]rule[#000000] for this Game requires the Composer to [#FF0000]vacate the Underground[#000000].
It is [#FF0000]unprecedented[#000000] for the Composer to be [#FF0000]absent during a Game[#000000]. I cannot predict what effect it may have.\n\nFurthermore, the Composer must [#FF0000]lower the frequency of his vibe[#000000] to travel from the UG to the RG, inevitably [#FF0000]curtailing his abilities[#000000].\n\nThis makes investigating the [#FF0000]Conductor[#000000] and his strategy incredibly [#FF0000]difficult[#000000], as the Composer is still the [#FF0000]only one who knows who and what I am[#000000].
It means lingering in the UG to author reports carries a [#FF0000]lethal risk[#000000].\n\nThe greatest randomizer in the current Game is the use of a [#FF0000]handpicked proxy[#000000] to compete against the [#FF0000]Conductor[#000000] in the Composer's stead. No information on this person exists at present.\n\nWhile the situation seems dire, I believe the [#FF0000]key[#000000] to getting ahead of all of this is at hand.
You see, time always builds [#FF0000]upon the past[#000000]. I have already located our [#FF0000]key[#000000]. It is a [#FF0000]pin request[#000000] from the [#FF0000]Conductor[#000000].\n\nNormally, the psych manifestations of pins are determined by one's [#FF0000]Imagination[#000000]. Thus, by analyzing the pin, the user's Imagination--or rather, their [#FF0000]true intentions[#000000]--are revealed.\n\nUnfortunately, this order came through the Composer, and never came into contact with the Conductor. Thus, I could not use it to determine the nature of his Imagination.
I, too, have [#FF0000]lowered my vibe[#000000] to tune in to the UG, [#FF0000]limiting my abilities[#000000].\n\nHowever, at this stage, realizing that this pin holds the key is sufficient. The possibility of [#FF0000]forestalling[#000000] the plans for the UG's destruction remains.


As the Game was set to end, I felt an intense [#FF0000]burst of Soul[#000000]. And at its source, I found the Composer's [#FF0000]handpicked proxy[#000000]--one [#FF0000]Neku Sakuraba[#000000].\n\nLet it be noted that once danger was past, the Soul he expelled [#FF0000]rapidly tapered off[#000000].\n\nI shall define Soul as it exists in the UG later. For now, let it suffice to say it is the [#FF0000]energy[#000000] he bears within him.
His unstable [#FF0000]Soul[#000000] is the result of a rift between his body and emotional mind.\n\nThis discord can be traced to a few causes:\n1: his dense and [#FF0000]all-inclusive[#000000] Soul composition,\n2: [#FF0000]emotional confusion[#000000] inhibiting the unity of his\nemotional self and physical body, and\n3: the exacerbation of that confusion by [#FF0000]memory\nloss, due to his entry fee[#000000].\n\nHowever, anyone possessing such diverse Soul can become a formidable wielder of [#FF0000]Imagination[#000000]. The Composer was right to choose this boy.
[#FF0000]Shibuya's fate[#000000] may rest on how well he manages to [#FF0000]stabilize his Soul[#000000].\n\nTo measure his stability, I gave him a [#FF0000]Harmonizer Pin[#000000]. It can only be used when he [#FF0000]cooperates with his partner[#000000].\n\n[#FF0000]Synchronizing[#000000] with another hinges on his ability to first stabilize his own Soul; thus, successful use of the pin would indicate he has made [#FF0000]progress on that front[#000000].
The further he is able to push his and his partner's [#FF0000]psych resonance[#000000] through Fusion, the greater his own internal stability will have become.\n\nThe progress of his Soul merits close observation henceforth.




Allow me to redefine the [#FF0000]Composer's[#000000] role. As I continue to observe the Game's progress, I have a clear view of the enormous effect of the Composer's [#FF0000]absence[#000000]. A clear definition of his duties are key to understanding the extent of this disruption.\n\nThe Composer holds [#FF0000]absolute authority[#000000] over the Underground. By \x22authority\x22 I mean the right to determine rules. He is the [#FF0000]only one who can change the composition of the UG[#000000], and sole creator of this Shibuya.
The Underground Shibuya is created and organized by the [#FF0000]Composer's rules[#000000], which pit Players against Reapers in a struggle for survival.\n\nA new Composer only arises [#FF0000]when the previous one is defeated[#000000]; the victor takes the victim's place. At this juncture, the new Composer [#FF0000]rewrites the rules of UG Shibuya[#000000].
However, there being no Composer at all is a different situation. It means the rules that make up the UG are [#FF0000]invalid[#000000].\n\nIn other words, without a Composer, the Underground [#FF0000]collapses[#000000].\n\nHowever, the Composer's absence is still a secret. At present, only [#FF0000]three people[#000000] know: the [#FF0000]Composer[#000000] himself; his opponent, the [#FF0000]Conductor[#000000]; and the [#FF0000]Producer[#000000]--me.
The [#FF0000]Producer's[#000000] role is that of [#FF0000]guardian[#000000] over the Game. For observation purposes, he must sometimes descend from the [#FF0000]Higher Plane[#000000] to the [#FF0000]Underground[#000000]. While the Producer is natively an [#FF0000]entity[#000000] from the Higher Plane, he can adjust the [#FF0000]frequency of his vibe[#000000] to visit the UG and lower planes.\n\nThink of a radio. Going from station A to station UG simply requires tuning in to a different frequency.\n\nThe Producer has the power to [#FF0000]contact[#000000] any and all beings in the Underground.
However, he is [#FF0000]strictly prohibited[#000000] from revealing his [#FF0000]identity[#000000] in the UG.\n\nHis existence endangers the stability of the rules and balance of the UG and RG. Thus, the Producer's identity [#FF0000]must stay a secret[#000000] from Reapers and Players--not to mention those in the RG.\n\nHe may freely contact only one person as the Producer, and that is the [#FF0000]Composer[#000000].



The UG exists as a separate plane where the Composer can [#FF0000]judge the worth of men[#000000].\n\nWithin it are Reapers and human Players. It is infeasible for the Composer to judge all of humanity by himself, so a [#FF0000]filtering system[#000000] utilizing the Reapers was created: the [#FF0000]Reapers' Game[#000000]. Reapers act as a test, weeding out unfit Players.\n\nUpon becoming a Reaper, one's physical body changes, gaining incredible strength and an extended lifespan.
As Reaper and Player alike progress through the Game, engaging in Imagination-driven combat, their [#FF0000]Soul[#000000] is refined.\n\nSoul is [#FF0000]abstract matter[#000000] revealed through Our research into life and death, and a component in the makeup of the atmosphere, humans, will, thought--all phenomena.\n\nAs [#FF0000]Reapers[#000000] execute the Game, they undergo a process of [#FF0000]evolution[#000000], from grunts to [#FF0000]officers[#000000] to the [#FF0000]Composer[#000000].
However, Reapers that follow the ideal route are rare, and most are erased by Players.\n\nReaper or Player, those erased within the Game disperse the mind and spirit housed within their flesh in the form of Soul. Thus, they are erased only from visible existence: their Soul [#FF0000]persists in the UG[#000000] until gathered and tied together according to a [#FF0000]new code[#000000].\n\nThis new code is, essentially, Imagination. Given sufficient Imagination, any form is possible, be it a pin or a Reaper.
Variations in this [#FF0000]code[#000000] cause the Soul to manifest in different forms.\n\nIn other words, humans, Reapers, and Noise are all entities formed of Soul. The only difference is their code.\n\nAnd what are [#FF0000]Noise[#000000]? Entities without conscious will, only the drive to multiply. Thus, they constantly [#FF0000]thirst for Soul[#000000], attacking Players and possessing humans in the Realground.
Soul consumed by Noise is destroyed, even if the Noise is erased.\n\nThus, possessed humans often exhibit a [#FF0000]rush of euphoria[#000000] immediately after the Noise is [#FF0000]removed[#000000].\n\nThough untested, the same would likely hold were a Player or Reaper possessed.



The Realground and Underground are [#FF0000]planes of existence[#000000]. Other planes exist as well: the one inhabited solely by [#FF0000]Noise[#000000], for example, or [#FF0000]Our[#000000] customary plane.\n\nThe planes are stacked in [#FF0000]parallel[#000000], though each exists at a different frequency [#FF0000]vibe[#000000], in tune with its inhabitants.\n\nObserving a [#FF0000]lower plane[#000000] from a [#FF0000]higher plane[#000000] is simple. Actual trans-planar contact, while possible, is highly complex. The vibes of [#FF0000]adjacent planes[#000000] are closer, making passage between them [#FF0000]comparatively easier[#000000].
More distant planes show greater differences in vibe frequencies, and thus communion becomes more difficult.\n\nThe UG exists [#FF0000]just above[#000000] the RG, allowing those in the UG to observe the RG, but not vice versa.\n\nNoise exist on a [#FF0000]special plane[#000000] that [#FF0000]straddles[#000000] both the RG and UG, enabling their interference in the affairs of [#FF0000]both[#000000]. When Players come into [#FF0000]contact[#000000] with Noise, they are drawn [#FF0000]into the Noise plane[#000000].
In other words, Players are [#FF0000]forcibly tuned in[#000000] to the Noise plane.\n\nConversely, there exists an [#FF0000]even higher plane[#000000] than the RG and UG. That is where I am from, the plane of the [#FF0000]Angels[#000000].\n\nAs in the RG and UG, Angels have created a web of [#FF0000]social schema[#000000] to guide their activities. The role of [#FF0000]Producer[#000000] is just [#FF0000]one cog[#000000] in the Angel machine.
Angel vibes are extremely high-frequency; not even the Composer can catch them all. In actuality, he can pick up only that of the Producer.\n\nAs you can see, inter-planar contact is beset by difficulty, but certain modes do exist for its realization.\n\nOne is the [#FF0000]modulator decal[#000000]. Within its area of effect, Players from the UG can [#FF0000]manifest visibly in the RG[#000000] and communicate with others there.
Reapers and the Composer can down-tune their vibes at will. Near these [#FF0000]decals[#000000], however, even their vibes will be forcibly adjusted to the lower frequency.\n\nAnother mode, [#FF0000]imprinting[#000000], requires no physical manifestation in the RG.\n\nImprintees experience the conferred thoughts as bursts of [#FF0000]inspiration[#000000]. The reliability of these communiqués thus depends upon the person receiving it.
For example, successful communication with preoccupied people is unlikely. Furthermore, recipient interpretation of said \x22inspiration\x22 colors the message, making imprinting unreliable at best.\n\n[#FF0000]\x22Reaper Creeper\x22[#000000] was created as a mode of [#FF0000]popular communication[#000000] between the planes. Modulating [#FF0000]paralogos[#000000] printed on paper allow for [#FF0000]limited UG interaction[#000000] with Realground objects. As those in the RG are unaware of Players, they perceive the illusion of a coin moving by itself.


I receive [#FF0000]periodic communication[#000000] from the [#FF0000]Composer[#000000]. While we maintain contact, I am prohibited from providing him with [#FF0000]information[#000000] for risk of unbalancing the Game.\n\nI am permitted only to respond to his commissions for certain [#FF0000]items[#000000], and even then am able only to create and deliver said items.\n\nThe Composer has requested increased [#FF0000]phone functionality[#000000] for use in the next Game.
Today, the [#FF0000]proxy's partner[#000000], one [#FF0000]Shiki Misaki[#000000], freed herself from her defining value--[#FF0000]envy[#000000]. With this, the Composer is convinced of the proxy's victory on the seventh day.\n\nHis confidence arises because the [#FF0000]proxy's intervention was indispensable[#000000] in causing his partner's growth. It signals the proxy's departure from his obsessive [#FF0000]self-actualization loop[#000000]. Previously, even the Composer was unsure of his proxy's capacity for growth.
Normally, the Composer possesses a certain degree of [#FF0000]clairvoyant foresight[#000000]. His current down-tuned state, however, [#FF0000]limits[#000000] his abilities, [#FF0000]clouding[#000000] this supertemporal vision.\n\nThough able to observe the UG from the Realground, he is otherwise saddled with [#FF0000]limitations[#000000].\n\nFor one, his [#FF0000]outward appearance[#000000]. He looks [#FF0000]younger[#000000] than he would at full vibe frequency within the UG. Fortunately, this prevents the Reapers from recognizing him as the Composer.
To begin with, the [#FF0000]Composer[#000000] contacts Reapers [#FF0000]only through the Conductor[#000000], so most are [#FF0000]unaware[#000000] of what he looks like. Additionally, as the being in the Underground with the highest vibe, some lesser Reapers are [#FF0000]incapable of perceiving him[#000000].\n\nThe effects of down-tuning occur because the Composer's vibe and the RG's frequency are substantially different.
For Reapers, the down-tuning necessary to exist in the RG is significantly less, and thus effects less prominent changes. That said, it depends on the Reaper. At any rate, the effect is minimal, making Reapers much more frequent visitors to the Realground.\n\nProvided they complete their duties, Reapers may do as they wish in the RG within certain accepted boundaries.



As the Composer predicted, [#FF0000]the proxy has won the Game[#000000].\n\nSo, [#FF0000]what happens[#000000] to those who survive the week? Those whose Imagination is less than outstanding are [#FF0000]broken down into Soul[#000000], while those with excellent Imagination become [#FF0000]Reapers[#000000]. The most talented of these may travel to the [#FF0000]next plane[#000000], inhabited by Us [#FF0000]Angels[#000000].\n\nDiligent Reapers, too, may pass through the office of Composer to ascend to the plane of Angels.
Now, a what if...\n\nThis may sound odd, but one may also choose to be [#FF0000]reincarnated[#000000]. Well, the word \x22reincarnation\x22 is not quite accurate, for the humans of the UG are [#FF0000]not truly dead[#000000]. They merely possess different Soul code, and have been tuned in to a different plane.\n\nWe Angels do not consider it a loss if a talented Player elects to return to the Realground, as their [#FF0000]superior Imagination[#000000] will inspire other humans.
Upon returning to life, the exceptional Player's creative activities soon make their mark upon society. His [#FF0000]art, music, and other output[#000000] become a part of culture, spreading and persisting through time, [#FF0000]refining[#000000] peoples' Imagination even without personal contact with the Player.\n\nCertainly, this requires time, but no one has ever accused Angels of being in a hurry. The Composer's [#FF0000]absence[#000000] during this particular Game, however, means that reincarnation is [#FF0000]not an option[#000000].
Only the [#FF0000]Composer[#000000] possesses the [#FF0000]level of Imagination[#000000] necessary to [#FF0000]reincarnate[#000000]. It is beyond the [#FF0000]Conductor's[#000000] means.\n\nThe Conductor continues to [#FF0000]act as if the Composer were present[#000000], but this farce can only continue for so long. I will be watching with great curiosity to see how the Conductor responds once his ruse unravels.\n\nAs I was busy writing reports, the boy in my custody, Beat, [#FF0000]went missing[#000000].
Beat had expressed curiosity in how Noise was created. Perhaps he plans to ask a Reaper. But even without specific instruction from them, he has the [#FF0000]ability[#000000] now.\n\nI gave him a pin filled with the special Imagination required to create Noise, and [#FF0000]imprinted him with instructions[#000000] for its use.\n\nThis does not qualify as interference in the Game.
The information I gave him will have no impact on the Game's results.\n\nIt was merely a token of my esteem for his unflinching [#FF0000]passion[#000000] towards what he holds dear. Whether he uses this power, and how, is completely up to him.


As predicted by the Composer, his proxy has entered the Game a [#FF0000]second time[#000000].\n\nThe proxy has proven his aptitude, and will be joined in the next Game by the Composer himself as his [#FF0000]new partner[#000000].\n\nThere are three reasons behind the Composer's choice of actions:\n1: to ascertain the [#FF0000]Conductor's strategy[#000000],\n2: to [#FF0000]educate[#000000] his proxy, and\n3: to [#FF0000]protect[#000000] him.
With his return to the UG, the limits on the Composer's abilities will be relaxed.\n\nHowever, [#FF0000]using his abilities could reveal his identity[#000000]. As such, he will need to continue to limit himself for a while longer. This presents a certain set of risks.\n\nThe greatest risk, however, lies with the Composer [#FF0000]joining the proxy for this Game[#000000].
The Composer's presence, his tremendously high vibe will place a great deal of [#FF0000]physical and psychological strain[#000000] on the proxy.\n\nFurthermore, the proxy's victory in the previous Game has won him back his memory. The [#FF0000]self-actualization loop[#000000] binding the proxy is thus [#FF0000]stronger than ever[#000000]--more deeply ensconced even than the [#FF0000]envy[#000000] cleared from Shiki in the previous Game.
There is a possibility of the proxy's Soul destabilizing, negating its progress during the previous Game. Slight problems also persist with the proxy's personality.\n\nHow long will the proxy be able to bear being side by side with the Composer?




Today, an [#FF0000]alert[#000000] was handed down: the discovery of a [#FF0000]Fallen Angel[#000000].\n\nA Fallen Angel is one who has broken the Angel's code--a [#FF0000]criminal[#000000]. Their crime: revealing the secrets of [#FF0000]Taboo Noise refinery[#000000] to the Game Master, Minamimoto.\n\nMinamimoto knows the Composer's RG identity (secret even to the Conductor), and has chased him to the Realground. The Fallen Angel may also have supplied him with this information.
Minamimoto lusts to take the Composer's place, and his potential to do so comes second only to that of the Conductor. Despite being a [#FF0000]complete outsider[#000000] in the wager between Composer and Conductor, he stands to [#FF0000]hinder[#000000] the Composer greatly. It is entirely possible Minamimoto may rise to the office of Conductor before this wager has been decided.\n\nAll eyes from the Higher Plane are on this Game for the future of Shibuya. Should its result be invalidated by outside interference, the Angels' disappointment would be vast.
So...\n\nWhat is the Fallen Angel's [#FF0000]goal[#000000]? Dominion over the Underground? Retribution against the Angels?\n\nWhatever the case, we must carefully monitor Minamimoto's actions and stay vigilant against this [#FF0000]Fallen Angel[#000000].





I was finally able to hand over the [#FF0000]phone tracking application[#000000] the Composer requested some time back.\n\nI informed the Composer it was ready three days ago, but they apparently had no time to come pick it up. It just shows how carefully the proxy is planning each move.\n\nThe application detects the [#FF0000]Conductor's Imagination[#000000]. With it, one can walk around Shibuya and piece together the Conductor's [#FF0000]strategy[#000000].
At this point, even I cannot fathom the Conductor's plan. I will have to rely on the information gathered by the Composer.\n\nWhile I wait for his findings, I will work on the Composer's next order--[#FF0000]a second revision[#000000] to the phone's functionality.\n\nToday also marks my first contact with the proxy since he formed a pact with the Composer. He appears considerably [#FF0000]wary of his partner[#000000] at present time.
As expected, the [#FF0000]psychological strain[#000000] is severe. So severe, in fact, that most Players would be unable to continue. Right now, the only thing keeping the proxy in the Game is his [#FF0000]entry fee[#000000].\n\nAt least his dangerously strained state of mind is acting to heighten his [#FF0000]Soul[#000000]. I saw no sign of relapse or destabilization; rather, the return of his memory seems to have yielded only positives.
I look forward to watching the proxy's [#FF0000]continued growth[#000000].




The Composer's reports indicate [#FF0000]rough going[#000000] in his investigation.\n\nI suspect the [#FF0000]limits[#000000] upon his abilities. Meanwhile, Minamimoto has not issued any missions. The Reaper elites must be alarmed as well. Perhaps this is more of the Fallen Angel's influence... As I've stated, Minamimoto is suspected of a liaison with a Fallen Angel.
The Fallen Angel may have [#FF0000]chosen Minamimoto[#000000] for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, none desired the Composer's office more. Minamimoto's obsession was great enough to compel him to pursue the Composer into the Realground.\n\nUnlike simple Reapers, however, the Composer's powers are not lost in the RG. I can just imagine the shock dawning on Minamimoto's face as I write this...
Yes, the Composer must [#FF0000]down-tune[#000000] to the frequency of the Realground, [#FF0000]limiting[#000000] his powers. However, Minamimoto is in the [#FF0000]same boat[#000000]. As a result, the difference in their abilities remained unchanged. Thus, the assassination attempt [#FF0000]failed[#000000].\n\nWhile Minamimoto's efforts were fruitless, they serve as ample proof of his convictions.\n\nThe second reason the Fallen Angel may have targeted him is his [#FF0000]lack of loyalty[#000000] to the Reapers' organization and his preference for solo action.
His distaste for cooperation meant little chance of him revealing the Fallen Angel's presence.\n\nThe third reason is his consistently [#FF0000]unconventional aesthetic[#000000]. His bizarre actions regularly cause confusion among those around him. Even if the Fallen Angel were to urge him to do something out of the ordinary, that would be ordinary for him. No one would suspect a thing.
This is why he is an ideal target for a Fallen Angel to work his agenda without raising suspicion. At least, it seems a logical conclusion.\n\nThe question now is, why has Minamimoto abandoned the Game, and what is he doing?\n\nI suspect that his only [#FF0000]current objective[#000000] is to [#FF0000]take out the Composer[#000000]. If so, he is likely preparing for the seventh day and his opportunity to confront the Players.
Just what did the Fallen Angel tell Minamimoto?\n\nPerhaps no one will ever know.


The proxy feels an affection for the art of the designer [#FF0000]CAT[#000000]--myself. As he was picked by the Composer, this is hardly coincidence. It was an [#FF0000]inevitability[#000000].\n\nCAT's creative works are embedded with [#FF0000]command codes[#000000]. His art acts as a medium for [#FF0000]mass imprinting[#000000].
The imprinting Players use works only on an [#FF0000]individual basis[#000000]. However, through art, one can affect [#FF0000]anyone who comes into contact with the work[#000000].\n\nI imbue my art with two command codes. The first is [#FF0000]\x22Enjoy the moment more.\x22[#000000] This strengthens the Imagination. The proxy received this signal loud and clear, though past [#FF0000]trauma[#000000] precluded him from responding accordingly.
The second code, [#FF0000]\x22Gather,\x22[#000000] calls to those with strong Imaginations. Hence the inevitability: why wouldn't the Composer find his worthy proxy standing in front of my graffiti?\n\nA single reason exists for rigging my art in this way: the [#FF0000]creation of the future[#000000] requires Imagination.\n
My art is widely accepted in Shibuya.\n\nThis proves that those with [#FF0000]Imaginations sufficient to create the future[#000000] are gathering in the area. Shibuya's future is looking very bright.




I have finished Revision Two of the [#FF0000]phone tracking app[#000000], which allows it to detect the [#FF0000]Shibuya River[#000000]. The Composer aims to use this device to [#FF0000]convey the river's location to the proxy[#000000].\n\nBefore passing that knowledge along, the Composer needed to understand the Conductor's plan. As of yesterday, he felt confident in his hypothesis.
The Composer had encountered [#FF0000]Red Skull pins[#000000] everywhere the detector had lead--the same pins I created at the Conductor's behest on the first day. As I suspected, they form a prime piece of his [#FF0000]strategy[#000000].\n\nThe Imagination he has filled those pins with is the same as that in the Player Pin: [#FF0000]imprinting[#000000]. They are set apart, however, by a single, major difference:
The Red Skull pins are made to [#FF0000]imprint targets with the Conductor's will[#000000].\n\nAnyone wearing the [#FF0000]Red Skull pin[#000000] is [#FF0000]dominated by the Conductor's mind[#000000]. The further the pins spread, the more people he controls. However, the Red Skull pins have penetrated [#FF0000]less than half[#000000] of Shibuya's Realground population in the last two weeks.\n\nAt this rate, the Conductor's strategy will end in failure.
How does he intend to penetrate the rest of Shibuya?\n\nI will be monitoring his actions closely.




The final day's mission came from the Conductor: [#FF0000]eliminate Minamimoto[#000000].\n\nUnexpected as it was, tension ran high, but the Composer's quick thinking saved the day. In the end, all went according to his plan, and he successfully guided the proxy on to the next Game.\n\nHis solution entailed first [#FF0000]defeating Minamimoto, thereby ensuring the proxy's victory[#000000]. Secondly, the Composer [#FF0000]pretended to be erased by Minamimoto[#000000] while shielding the proxy.
To accomplish this, he [#FF0000]fled to a parallel world[#000000] just before Minamimoto's final attack connected.\n\nThe proxy survived the Game alone, but was again [#FF0000]unable to elect reincarnation[#000000], due to the Composer's [#FF0000]illegal participation[#000000] in the Game.\n\nFor better or worse, the Game between the Composer and Conductor concludes in [#FF0000]one week's time[#000000].
The Conductor's strategy may end in failure, but we will see. I need to keep a close eye on his future actions. \n\nAll I can do is wait for the Composer to inform me of which parallel world he escaped to.





I've begun patrolling Shibuya in pursuit of the Conductor's strategy. While in Udagawa, I spotted Minamimoto's [#FF0000]Taboo Noise refinery sigil[#000000].\n\nSeveral types of these sigils exist in various categories which We of the Higher Plane have classified. [#FF0000]Not all of them, however, will work in the UG[#000000]--its vibe frequency is simply [#FF0000]too low[#000000] for them to translate properly.
The [#FF0000]sigil[#000000] Minamimoto drew was one of these [#FF0000]undecodable[#000000] types. Was that a mistake on the Fallen Angel's part? Or was it a transcription error by Minamimoto?\n\nEither way, with that design, he stands little chance of reviving himself.\n\nHowever, Minamimoto is driven, and his Imagination strong. Perhaps strong enough to make a Taboo sigil work, even in the Underground... If so, the specific result would be impossible to predict.
Anything that might [#FF0000]interfere[#000000] with the Composer and Conductor's wager is to be avoided at any cost. I will personally [#FF0000]neutralize Minamimoto's sigil[#000000].\n\nAngels may not interfere in the Reapers' Game, but this contest will decide Shibuya's future. The Higher Plane cannot idly stand by.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conductor has dealt a [#FF0000]preemptive blow[#000000]: the starting Player count in this final Game is [#FF0000]one[#000000].
I cannot be certain whether the Conductor knows that Neku Sakuraba is the proxy, but this severe restriction in the number of entrants ensures Player erasure. In this flagrant [#FF0000]abuse[#000000] of his privilege, he has eliminated the threat of the proxy.\n\nWith the Composer in a parallel world, the proxy's position is perilous. Still, as Producer, I am bound by the [#FF0000]rules[#000000]. I can offer him no help...
All I can do is [#FF0000]guide him to the Shibuya River[#000000].\n\nCall it luck or fate, even by himself the proxy has managed to form a pact. He's partnered to Beat, now a Reaper, who is himself fixated on reaching the river. As such, guiding the proxy will require little work on my part.\n\nStill, I haven't uncovered the Conductor's strategy for this final week. I can't afford to relax quite yet.



The Conductor has used Beat's betrayal as an excuse to issue an [#FF0000]Emergency Call[#000000].\n\nWith it, the Composer's rules for the UG are essentially [#FF0000]suspended[#000000]. After weeks of concealing the Composer's absence, the Conductor finally has [#FF0000]absolute authority[#000000].\n\nAt the same time, he's made Red Skull pins [#FF0000]mandatory for all Reapers[#000000].
Now [#FF0000]most of Shibuya[#000000] has a Red Skull pin. The stage has been set for the Conductor's [#FF0000]counterattack[#000000].\n\nFurthermore, he's [#FF0000]cordoned off each area of the UG with walls[#000000]. I could leave the UG, elevate my vibe, and pass through them quite easily, but to what end? I am bound to the UG, and thus my hands are tied.
I cannot reach the Composer, nor do I know in which parallel world he's hiding.\n\nFor now, all I can do is use my [#FF0000]second sight[#000000] to watch the Game's progress.





Rather than head to the Shibuya River, the proxy has begun wandering the streets, apparently [#FF0000]in pursuit of the Game Master[#000000].\n\nKonishi, this round's Game Master, seems mainly interested in [#FF0000]saving her own skin[#000000].\n\nShe appears a loyal follower of the Conductor, but the appearance of a promising candidate for Composer would quickly change her tune. At this point, she has been working hard to recover the Conductor's trust after her slip the first day.
She has issued a [#FF0000]single six-day mission[#000000]--one that exploits [#FF0000]Beat's greatest weakness[#000000]: [#FF0000]Rhyme[#000000].\n\nHer plan is to panic the pair into committing some fatal error while keeping watch from her front-row seat within [#FF0000]Beat's shadow[#000000]. This serves both to restore her standing with the Conductor and to [#FF0000]avenge[#000000] the blow to her pride.
Beat's greatest [#FF0000]desire[#000000] is to bring her [#FF0000]back to life[#000000].\n\nEven if revived, though, Rhyme still lost the Game. Her entry fee is [#FF0000]non-refundable[#000000]. I do not know what the girl's entry fee was, but a life without it--the thing she held [#FF0000]most dear[#000000]--would be filled with grief and hardship.\n\nBut is the void in one's heart caused by loss never filled?
I think it can be. It may take time, but something else will come along to fill that empty space--so long as one enjoys the present.\n\nIn other words, we needn't mourn the loss of that which we hold dear. If only more people realized this...\n\nThe Composer did not impose the entry fee upon Players to cause them anguish.
In experiencing life without the thing one [#FF0000]most values[#000000], Players are forced to reexamine just how crucial those things really are. The hope is that by the close of the Game, Players will be able to [#FF0000]take a hard look at themselves[#000000], and be able to take on the future with a [#FF0000]new outlook on life[#000000].\n\nThe entry fee exists to force Players to see the truth about themselves. It is a test posed by the Composer to [#FF0000]spur Players' self-enlightenment[#000000].



The [#FF0000]Conductor[#000000] has begun his work with the [#FF0000]Red Skull pins[#000000]. By bringing Shibuya's collective consciousness in line with his own, he hopes to accomplish his goal of [#FF0000]rebuilding Shibuya[#000000].\n\nThe Conductor's zeal is unparalleled among Reapers. His strong presence was central to the Composer's ability to govern Shibuya, an area considered exceptionally chaotic even among the Higher Plane's denizens.
That the [#FF0000]Composer would consent to base his plans for Shibuya's destruction on a [#FF0000]Game with the Conductor[#000000] shows his unwavering trust in his subordinate.\n\nThe unification of minds is the natural state of the Higher Plane. Given time, it might happen throughout the Underground. The current UG, however, is [#FF0000]not ready[#000000].\n\nPeople have erected [#FF0000]walls[#000000] around their minds, dividing their collective consciousness.
They coexist independently, like the cells that make up a single human being.\n\nWhile the [#FF0000]Player Pin[#000000] holds [#FF0000]Imagination[#000000] strong enough to pass through those walls, the pin user's own barriers are [#FF0000]strengthened[#000000]. Were that not the case, the incoming flood of other minds could erode at the user's own consciousness. Consequently, those who hold Player Pins [#FF0000]cannot be scanned[#000000].
Why does [#FF0000]individuality[#000000] exist?\n\nThis is something the Conductor has overlooked. Everything that exists has a purpose. Obsessed with his egoistic \x22protection\x22 of Shibuya, the Conductor has blinded himself to the facts. With his blind ego funneled into everyone in Shibuya, the city's destruction is not far off.\n\nSo long as there is individuality, it is impossible to fully eliminate loneliness. There is no such thing as a shared reality.
Even people who believe they share a [#FF0000]connection[#000000] are [#FF0000]not truly connected[#000000]. They must actually make contact, [#FF0000]clash[#000000], and learn about others through their foreignness.\n\nDifferences should not be denied; they should be accepted and enjoyed.\n\nPeople must realize this if Shibuya is to be [#FF0000]spared from destruction[#000000].



I've detected an [#FF0000]energy spike[#000000] here. It would seem [#FF0000]Minamimoto has returned[#000000].\n\nI judged his revival unlikely after spotting his [#FF0000]Taboo refinery sigil[#000000] on the first day, but it appears Minamimoto's Imagination is [#FF0000]much stronger than I'd anticipated[#000000]. The [#FF0000]Fallen Angel[#000000] must have completed the array for him. A troubling thought. Who can say what impact this will have on the Composer and Conductor's Game?\n\n[#FF0000]Minamimoto[#000000] has one goal now: to [#FF0000]find the Composer and erase him[#000000].
Minamimoto has been tracking the Composer's movements. He must know that the [#FF0000]Composer frequents this café[#000000]. Chances are, he'll pay a visit [#FF0000]himself[#000000].\n\nAs for the Composer, I have yet to receive any word from him. Could the Composer's abilities now be so limited that he cannot even reach me?\n\nI may need to [#FF0000]contact myselves in the parallel worlds[#000000] to help search for him.
Let me expand on the concept of [#FF0000]parallel worlds[#000000].\n\nIn life, reality is made up of a continuous string of choices, and the consequences of those choices. Every time a choice is made, the option not selected branches off and exists as its own reality: a [#FF0000]parallel world[#000000].\n\n[#FF0000]Countless numbers[#000000] of such parallel worlds exist within a single plane, be it the RG or the UG, and [#FF0000]travel among them is possible[#000000] through the use of Imagination.
Theoretically, anyone can jump to a parallel world, but penetrating the membrane between worlds [#FF0000]requires up-tuning one's vibe[#000000]. This limits the pool of beings able to make the trip.\n\nAdditionally, [#FF0000]stress[#000000] caused by breaking through the barrier can pull down the traveler's base vibe. If the vibe dips, the frequency may be too low to pass through the barrier. In the worst cases, it may render the traveler [#FF0000]unable to return to his or her own original world[#000000].
Conversely, [#FF0000]Angels[#000000] are beings [#FF0000]meant to jump between worlds[#000000]. Thus, such travel is a simple matter.\n\nAngels have a higher base vibe than the frequency of the Underground, allowing them to leave the UG, then tune their vibe to that of the desired parallel world.



I have [#FF0000]located[#000000] the Composer.\n\nHe is in a world where [#FF0000]Tin Pin Slammer[#000000]--of all things!--reigns supreme. I am off to retrieve him.\n\nMinamimoto has definitely targeted this shop, and not with friendly intentions. It is essential that I leave here immediately.\n\nI will leave the [#FF0000]keypin to the Shibuya River[#000000] for the proxy. He should know what to do from there.
[#FF0000]Shibuya's fate[#000000] has been placed in the proxy's hands.\n\nIt is no longer safe for me in the UG. My work here is done.\n\nAll that remains is to retrieve the Composer from the parallel world, and bring him back to this one.






[#FF0000]The Composer defeated the Conductor.[#000000]\n\n[#FF0000]The Composer defeated the proxy.[#000000]\n\nHowever, he has [#FF0000]stayed his decision to destroy Shibuya[#000000]. It seems the course of the Game has brought about a [#FF0000]change of heart[#000000] in the Composer.\n\nYes, Shibuya persists--but it is [#FF0000]no longer the same city as it was a month ago[#000000].
In its stead, a [#FF0000]completely new Shibuya[#000000] has arisen. As the [#FF0000]Composer[#000000] has changed, so [#FF0000]Shibuya itself has metamorphosed[#000000].\n\nOne month previous, Shibuya was [#FF0000]plagued with problems[#000000]--dire enough to motivate the Composer to [#FF0000]destroy it[#000000].\n\nToday, Shibuya has shifted into what We [#FF0000]Angels[#000000] believe to be the [#FF0000]optimal parallel world[#000000].
To complete this puzzle, all of the pieces had to be set in their proper place. If even one was incorrect, the entire picture would be ruined.\n\n[#FF0000]Rhyme's[#000000] selfless display of kindness. \n[#FF0000]Higashizawa's[#000000] bottomless career ambitions.\n[#FF0000]Konishi's[#000000] heart of stone.\nThe [#FF0000]Conductor's[#000000] wild actions, born from overflowing love.\n\nAll of these were [#FF0000]necessary[#000000] if Shibuya was to be born anew. [#FF0000]There are no extra pieces, no irrelevant components![#000000]
Accept society as an ever-changing thing, and your mind will also become flexible. [#FF0000]Individuals will link together, and enact change throughout society[#000000].\n\nThis is the only way to weather--no, to [#FF0000]ride high upon the waves of the ever-changing world[#000000]. It was no coincidence the Composer opted for this simple method in the end.
My gratitude goes out to you all. I greatly look forward to what this new Shibuya will become.\n\nThank you.



I entered the parallel world and [#FF0000]contacted the Composer[#000000]. Unexpectedly, he seemed to be enjoying his stay. In fact, the reason he had not contacted me was because he was too busy playing [#FF0000]Tin Pin[#000000]. I made him promise to [#FF0000]meet me at the Shibuya River[#000000]. In the meantime, I need to [#FF0000]hide out[#000000], so as not to meet myself in this world.\n\nUsually, Angels existing as multiple entities within the same world poses little problem. However, mine is a somewhat...[#FF0000]special case[#000000].
[#FF0000]You see, I am the Fallen Angel who taught Minamimoto how to refine Taboo Noise.\n\nMinamimoto owes his successful rebirth to the corrections I made to his flawed Taboo refinery sigil.\n\nI must hide in Pork City for fear that my alternate self in this world may report me on sight.[#000000]
[#FF0000]Minamimoto is my backup plan to ensure Shibuya's survival. If the Composer does not change his mind, this unique city will be lost.\n\nI must prevent that at any cost.\n\nThus, I've deemed it necessary to cross the boundaries Angels usually respect. I happily accept the stigma of Fallen Angel for this cause.[#000000]\n
Well then. It's about time to meet him...\n\nAfter calling the Composer and hearing his cheery voice, I feel as if my shadow falls even darker.\n\nBut [#FF0000]darkness has always been husband to light[#000000]. I sincerely hope that someday my sins will be judged justified.\n\nI still hold faith that they will. Now, and\nforevermore...
One last thing. To the Composer's [#FF0000]pick[#000000].\n\n[#FF0000]Neku Sakuraba[#000000]...\n\n[#FF0000]The future you must choose is within you.[#000000] I am glad to have had the chance to meet you.



Thanks to the [#FF0000]Composer's change of heart[#000000] (brought on by exposure to [#FF0000]his proxy's unbridled Imagination[#000000]), Shibuya has been [#FF0000]restored[#000000] to its original state. Crisis averted.\n\nAlthough the rules have undergone some slight revisions in the wake of Shibuya's rebirth, the powers that be deemed no major changes were necessary, saying it's better to keep things [#FF0000]easy to understand[#000000].
For now, it seems, the Game will remain the same. The Composer will continue to use it as a tool by which he can judge the worth of visitors from the RG.\n\nIn other words, [#FF0000]everything is back to normal[#000000].\n\n...Well, in Shibuya, at least. The [#FF0000]incident[#000000] outside the city has piqued the Composer's interest—and rightfully so. [#FF0000]Neither one of us has ever seen it happen[#000000] so close to home.

Two boys I know quite well seem to have [#FF0000]vanished from the RG[#000000] a few hours ago.\n\nWhat's more is that I've detected several [#FF0000]spikes in activity[#000000] over the past few days during regularly scheduled retunings.\n\nWhile I have yet to find an explanation for the [#FF0000]unexpected trouble[#000000] that has accompanied Noise outbreaks and interplanar travel as of late, I can't help but think it must be [#FF0000]connected[#000000] to those boys' sudden disappearance.
For now, I've decided to investigate a certain [#FF0000]Noise[#000000] that made some major waves when it first appeared. Something about it strikes me as suspicious.\n\nAlthough I have no evidence definitively tying the emergence of this Noise to the [#FF0000]aforementioned incident[#000000], my intuition tells me the former was somehow caused by the latter. We'll see what I turn up when I check out the scene.\n\nSpeaking of which, it looks like the Composer is making moves of his own. We haven't coordinated our efforts, but I've got a hunch we're headed in the same direction.

It turns out the enormous Noise under that little Reaper's control was actually a [#FF0000]pseudo-parallel world[#000000] artifically constructed by breaking down and forcibly rebinding the Soul from various Noise.\n\nThis sort of unusual and unstable dimension is extremely fragile, so we gave up on the idea of down-tuning our vibes to launch an infiltration. Instead, I [#FF0000]interfered[#000000] with the Noise from the outside by using an advanced method of imprinting.\n\nMy goal was to [#FF0000]save both boys[#000000]. \nUnfortunately, I could only save [#FF0000]one[#000000].
A pseudo-parallel world like that one is [#FF0000]special[#000000] in that it is [#FF0000]heavily dependent upon its creator[#000000].\n\n[#FF0000]A considerable Imagination[#000000] is required to create such a world—far greater than that of any run-of-the-mill Reaper. I suspect [#FF0000]someone[#000000] must have given that little girl a hand.
And what about those [#FF0000]mysterious visions[#000000] that invaded Neku's consciousness? What about that [#FF0000]abnormal power[#000000] and [#FF0000]whoever[#000000] created it? What about the [#FF0000]Reaper[#000000] resummoned into the UG via a refinery sigil?\n\nAll of these phenomena occurred almost simultaneously with the aforementioned incident in Shinjuku—that is, the [#FF0000]Inversion[#000000]. But is it possible a single event could truly have such [#FF0000]widespread repercussions[#000000]? I'm determined to find out.
