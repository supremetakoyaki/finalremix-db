[#FF0000]Tin Pin Slammer[#000000] (Tin Pin for short) is a mini-game where you use the [#FF0000]pins you're wearing[#000000] to try to [#FF0000]knock opponents' pins off the table[#000000].
Your pin order in Tin Pin Slammer is determined by the pins' [#FF0000]slot numbers[#000000]. You use the pin in slot 1 first, then the rest in ascending order.
[#FF0000]Draw a line and hold your finger to the screen[#000000] to charge. Aim carefully, then [#FF0000]lift your finger[#000000] to perform a powerful [#FF0000]Charge Slam[#000000].
Slash your pin down the middle and it will travel in a straight line, but did you know you can [#FF0000]slash along its edge[#000000] to apply spin and [#FF0000]make it curve[#000000]?
[#FF0000]Tap the bomb button[#000000] to use the [#FF0000]Dive Bomber[#000000]. Your pin will rocket into the air, then [#FF0000]come crashing down[#000000] onto the spot you target!
[#FF0000]Tap the stinger button[#000000] to use the [#FF0000]Stinger[#000000]. Bust out this [#FF0000]defensive technique[#000000] to turn the table on foes flying at you!
[#FF0000]Tap the hammer button[#000000] to use the [#FF0000]Sledgehammer[#000000]. Start that hammer swinging and make the most of its [#FF0000]long attack range[#000000]!
The [#FF0000]Helping Hand[#000000] will automatically save your pin when it falls off the table, letting you literally [#FF0000]jump back into the game[#000000]!
Want to collect every pin out there? Then you'll need to be resourceful and uncover the [#FF0000]mysterious forces that drive pin evolution[#000000].
Collect [#FF0000]Battle PP[#000000] every time you play a game of Tin Pin Slammer. Practicing is a great way to hone your slammin' skills while also earning PP!
Collect [#FF0000]Battle PP[#000000] at the Results screen after erasing Noise in combat. You have to [#FF0000]fight Noise[#000000] if you want this type of PP!
Collect [#FF0000]Shutdown PP[#000000] while you're not playing and the power is off. This way, you can still earn PP even if you [#FF0000]take a break from the game[#000000]!
Did you know [#FF0000]some pins work better than others[#000000] for landing [#FF0000]cross combos[#000000] with a given partner? Build your deck wisely!
Did you know it's [#FF0000]easier to deal damage to Taboo Noise[#000000] when you attack [#FF0000]with your partner[#000000]? Better get those cross combos down!
Did you know that landing [#FF0000]cross combos[#000000] gives your sync rate a [#FF0000]major boost[#000000]? Practice that timing!
Did you know a higher sync rate makes it easier to attain Fusion? Be careful not to [#FF0000]run away[#000000] from multiple battles in a row, or you'll [#FF0000]de-sync[#000000].
Did you know Neku can pull off better [#FF0000]aerial combos[#000000] by [#FF0000]using sub-slots to quickly switch[#000000] between pin psychs whose [#FF0000]touch commands overlap[#000000]?
Did you know pins in [#FF0000]lower-numbered slots respond to touch commands first[#000000]? If you can't seem to use a psych, [#FF0000]reorder your deck[#000000].
Did you know eating is a science? If you have [#FF0000]a lot of time[#000000] on a given day, [#FF0000]start by eating food that boosts your Attack or Defense[#000000].
Did you know item abilities are less about power and more about [#FF0000]customization[#000000]? Pick an outfit \x22suitable\x22 for the situation at hand.
Did you know some pins can only be acquired through evolution? If you're [#FF0000]gunning for 100%[#000000], don't just rely on shops and battles.
Did you know [#FF0000]Reaper Creeper[#000000] can solve all your problems? All you need is a coin, a sheet of paper, and a few crayons. (Mileage may vary.)
